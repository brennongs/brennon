      <h5 class="title is-size-2">When I was seven,</h5>
      <p class="is-size-4">my mom married the very most stereotypical computer junkie you can imagine. The first time I met him, he forgot that we were getting dinner because he was playing Diablo (the first one). I first became familiar with the insides of a computer when my parents bought a house and the unfinished basement became a graveyard of old CPU's and discarded RAM.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="is-size-4">At eleven he showed me the command line. At thirteen he showed me Linux. At fiteen I got my first job in high school building computers part time for an IT service provider. In my down time I would go onsite with the techs to be bewildered at networking.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="is-size-4">At 20 I sort of fell into IT, which to date I consider my second favorite accident. I worked Tech Support for a local ISP. Probably the most important thing I learned was how to watch ASCII Star Wars through Telnet. Through the next five years I worked various tech jobs, and I loved it, but I didn't want to just <strong>use</strong> the tools. I wanted to <strong>make</strong> them.</p>
      <br>
      <h4 class="is-size-3">So I went to DevMountain.</h4>
      <br>
      <p class="is-size-4">I learned JavaScript and CSS, React, Node.js. I learned all about Bash scripts and HTTP and SQL. In my free time (hah) I built a Linux box to host my own projects (including my custom Plex/SMB server). <strong>Tech makes me tick.®*</strong> </p>
      <br>
      <p class="is-size-4">But probably the most important thing I've learned about tech since becoming a developer is that <strong>tech is totally useless if we forget what it's for</strong>. I love tech because it can solve real problems that real people face every day. I can automate keeping track of tax write-offs so my father-in-law doesn't have to. I can host movies from my house so that it doesn't suck so bad when something isn't on Netflix (<a href="/" class="link">#firstWorldProbs</a>).</p>
      <br>
      <p class="is-size-4">All in all, I love tech, and I love to solve problems. <strong>So what are we going to solve together?</strong></p>
